            Hi! My name is Martin Parizek and I created this side project in
            August 2022 to show what I learnt while working mainly with React,
            Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
            I thought about a project that could easily make people find their
            favourite movies while having a space to store them at the same
            time. That is why I build this user-friendly app where you can
            search for whatever movie you have in mind, and keep it safe in a
            favorite list. Try it, enjoy it and feel free to leave any
            suggestion on what I could improve on the coding side. Lastly, if
            you want to get to know me a little more, you can check the personal
            info at the Footer. <br />
            Thanks for reading, hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
